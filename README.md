# Housing-Price-Prediction
A housing price prediction model using Linear Regression

A prediction model built to predict house prices based on the features that aregiven in the dataset.

The dataset which we have used in this model is named: London.csv. 

The dataset contain data regarding the house prices in London.

Property Name e.g. Queen Road
Price e.g. 735000
House Type e.g. House
Area in sq ft e.g. 814
No. of Bedrooms e.g. 5
No. of Bathrooms e.g 4
No. of Receptions e.g. 5
Location e.g. Wimbledon
City/County e.g. London
Postal Code e.g. SW19 8NY

We have used a supervised machine learning algorithm - linear regression

But before applying the algorithm we did data analysis and feature preprocessing which is present in the jupyter notebook.
